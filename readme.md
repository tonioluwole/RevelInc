This is just a demo website I worked on that met some specific php/java script requirements
•	Products were added to a MySQL database.
•	PHP search bar functionality.
•	Pulling product information from the MySQL database with PHP.
• A page that allows you to input images and information to create and add a new product to the database.
•	When you click on a product image on search page, that will direct you to the product page.

Enjoy!
